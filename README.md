# MovieWebsite_Python
We need to have Python installed on our computer to do this project.
A webpage which displays a list of my favorite movies and when clicked on the poster of the movie, the trailer is the played on Youtube.
For each movie, it displays the title, storyline and the poster image of the movie.
Python files: media.py, entertainment_center.py, fresh_tomatoes.py
HTML files: fresh_tomatoes.html
media.py python files has one class and two functions in it.
class Movie and functions __init__ and show_trailer.
class Movie has six instances in the entertainment_center.py python file. The six instances are the six movies displayed on the webpage.
They are toy_story, avatar, eat_pray_love, lion, the_blind_side, the_notebook.
All the instances are listed into a single list movies
This movies list is passed to the fresh_tomatoes.html file.
We need to have all the files(media.py, entertainment_center.py, fresh_tomatoes.py) to be saved after the changes we have made.
When we run the entertainment_center.py, browser opens and displays the output.
